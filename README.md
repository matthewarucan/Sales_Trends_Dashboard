# ðŸ“Š Sales Trends Visualization (Tableau)

Created an interactive Tableau dashboard to explore seasonal sales trends from my personal eBay dataset (2021â€“2024). The dashboard breaks down sales performance by day of week, week of year, and month, revealing when sales peak or decline. Key features include:

- Daily Trends: Sundays and Saturdays consistently outperform weekdays, averaging over $21K, signaling strong weekend demand.
- Monthly Trends: Sales spike in August but drop sharply in October, with an average monthly sales benchmark of $12K shown as a reference line.
- Weekly Trends: Week 31 (late July to early August) sees the highest revenue, while Week 53 (end of December) shows a steep dropâ€”highlighting a 95% decline in weekly sales.
- Total Sales KPI Tile: Displays total annual revenue (e.g., $42K in 2023), with year-over-year performance comparison (â–¼ -5.48% vs. previous year).
- Dynamic Tooltips & Highlights: Allows users to quickly identify performance highs/lows and track seasonal shifts.

This dashboard empowers quick diagnosis of underperforming periods (like Q4) and supports strategy development around free shipping, category prioritization, and holiday event planning.
